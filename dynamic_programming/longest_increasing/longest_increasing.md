# Longest Increasing subsequence

## Question

Given an array of integers find the longest increasing subsequence. Notice what a subsequence
means is not a continuous sequence but any set that maintains the ordering and has the 
increasing property.

## Logic

From the first element onwards find the maximum length subsequence
