# Coin problem 

## Question 

This is a really basic problem that can be solved using dynamic programming. Given a set of
coins that have infinite number of each type. And a value find a way to represent the value
as a sum of the coins provided such that the number of the coins are minimum.

## Logic 

We can make a naive solution to solve this recursively and doing complete search. The 
recursion consists of finding which choice of coin produces the minimum at each step.

Now if we store the solutions of each sub-problem when they are solved we can say that we
solve each sub-problem only once.
