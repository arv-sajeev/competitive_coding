# Divide array in to sets of consecutive numbers

## Question 

Given an array of integers and a number k. Find whether is is possible to form sub-sequences of size
K using all the elements, and with elements in the sequence being consecutive.

## Logic

* First you could check if size of array is a multiple of K
* the use an ordered map to keep frequency and traverse and check is sequences can be formed
