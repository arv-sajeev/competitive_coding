# Pseudocode 

I am essentially a very lazy person, but irrespective of that it seems dumb to do every single problem on leetcode without any filter,
So I thought I'll read through the problem set now and atleast jot down the basic idea of each problem or a concept introduced by a problem for future reference.

I've coded up the stuff that really seem necessary the rest are all in here.

Work smart rather than hard I guess.
