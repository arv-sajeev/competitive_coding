# 1. bits are cool yo 
* using the recursive strategy we get an idea how powersets are made
* there are 2^n subsets
* each subset can be represented by a number from 0-2^n
* when we look at its binary form each 1 is a selection whereas each 0 is ignoring 
* find each bit and find whether the element is to be included in the subset
