# 1. Introduction 

* This is the recursion method shown in geeks for geeks 
* in each level of recursion the ith element is swapped with all the elements after it 
* In the first level the first element is swapped with the n possible elements including itself
* now for each of these branches the 2nd element formed after the swappin in level 1 is swapped with each of the n-1 available elements since the one to the left is kept constant 
* from the tree we can see graphically how it becomes n! values
