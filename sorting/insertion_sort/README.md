# Insertion Sort

## 1. Concept 
	Incrementally take each element from the unsorted partition  and "insert" it into its position in the sorted partition. We make space for each insertion by shifting all of the others to the right

## 2. Stats
	* Worst case O(n^2) reverse sorted
	* best case O(n) already sorted
	* it is quite fast for small arrays 
	* it is a stable sort and is adaptive
	* it can be online sorted
