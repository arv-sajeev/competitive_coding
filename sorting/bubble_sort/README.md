# Insertion Sort

## 1. Concept

* The heaavier elements float to the top or bubble their way to the top
* Iterate through the array n-1 times
* Each traversal keep swapping the grater element upwards
* So for the ith traversal teh n-i-1th postion will get filled
* In the last iteration the element left will be in the right palce because all the other elements are in their respective places

## 2. Stats

* worst case O(n^2) best case when it is already sorted O(n)
* In practice it has been found to be a very a bad choice for sorting 
* in place and stable
