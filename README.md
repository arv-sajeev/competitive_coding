# Competitive coding

Thought I'll try my hand at some competitive coding questions and problem solving. I'm using a book by this finnish dude Anti Laakonsen here is a link to his book [Competitive Progammer's handbook] (https://cses.fi/book/index.php). I'm trying to follow it sequentially and the aim is to make 5 additons everyday for a week and bump it up till 10 for every additional week, lets see how it goes.
